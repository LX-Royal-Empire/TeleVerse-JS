# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Introduction
Welcome to **TeleVerse-JS**! We’re thrilled to have you here and grateful for your interest in contributing. To maintain a respectful, inclusive, and positive community, we ask all contributors to follow this code of conduct. We value every member's input and are committed to fostering an environment where everyone feels welcome, safe, and encouraged to contribute.

## Our Pledge
In the interest of cultivating a friendly, welcoming environment, we pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. This applies regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behavior
To help maintain a positive community, we ask that participants:
- Be kind and respectful to others.
- Be open to constructive feedback and be willing to help others who seek guidance.
- Refrain from using offensive, discriminatory, or unwelcome language.
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences and remain courteous even when disagreeing.
- Be considerate of how your actions affect the community and project.

### Unacceptable Behavior
The following behaviors are unacceptable within our community:
- **Harassment and Discrimination**: This includes any form of insult or verbal attack based on race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, religion, or other personal characteristics.
- **Trolling, Insults, and Derogatory Comments**: Personal attacks or demeaning comments will not be tolerated.
- **Unwelcome Sexual Attention or Advances**: This includes inappropriate and unsolicited comments, jokes, or imagery.
- **Disruptive Behavior**: Behaviors that are intentionally destructive to the community or project, including spamming, derailing discussions, or repeatedly refusing to adhere to community standards.

## Reporting Issues
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as possible to our team at [lxroyalempire@outlook.com]. All reports will be handled with confidentiality, and we will take prompt, appropriate action to ensure a safe and inclusive environment.

In your report, please include:
- A description of the behavior or issue
- When and where it occurred
- Any additional context that might help us understand the situation

Our team is committed to reviewing all reports with care and sensitivity. We will respond within a reasonable timeframe and take any necessary steps to address the issue.

## Enforcement
Community members who violate this code of conduct may face consequences. These actions may include, but are not limited to:
- A written warning with specific guidelines for improvement
- Temporary suspension from interacting in the project’s spaces
- Permanent ban from all project-related spaces

The severity of the action will depend on the nature of the violation and the impact on the community. We reserve the right to remove any content or contributors that do not align with our code of conduct.

## Acknowledgments
