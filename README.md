## Quick Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js 18.x or higher installed
- A Telegram Bot Token (obtain from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))
- A Vercel account

### Vercel Deployment

1. Fork this repository
2. Log in to your Vercel account
3. Create a new project and import your forked repository
4. Configure the environment variables (add your `BOT_TOKEN`)
5. Deploy the project


### Setting the Webhook

After deployment, set your webhook using the following URL format:

```plaintext
https://api.telegram.org/bot<BOT_TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<VERCEL_URL>/api/bot
```

Replace `<BOT_TOKEN>` with your actual bot token and `<VERCEL_URL>` with your Vercel deployment URL.

## Usage

### Creating New Commands

To add new commands, edit the `api/bot.js` file:

```javascript
bot.command('yourcommand', async (ctx) => {
    await ctx.reply('Your response here');
});
```

### Handling Messages

To process incoming messages, use the `bot.on('message')` event:

```javascript
bot.on('message', async (ctx) => {
    await ctx.reply('I received your message!');
});
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Webhook errors**: Ensure your Vercel URL is correct and the webhook is properly set.
- **Bot not responding**: Check if your BOT_TOKEN is correctly set in the environment variables.
- **Deployment issues**: Verify that all dependencies are correctly listed in `package.json`.
